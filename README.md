# Microplastics

## Project Goal

I wish to identify the origins and the future direction of microplastics based on current scientific research. 

## Data Source 

I obtained the microplastics scientific articles from https://www.scopus.com/home.uri. Thankfully I was able to access to thousands of scientific article with my student university account. 1600+ scientific article were downloaded using the informational search query "Microplastics".

## Data Description 

This dataset consists of different journals from multiple field of studies ranging from environmental science to material science.

# Conclusion

Text extraction and processing were performed in this project. Text analysis were performed using topic modelling and 20 topics were retrieved from a corpus of 1554 different articles. Hierachical clustering was used to grouped the similar topics together. Lastly, a heatmap was plotted to see the correlation between the different topics. 

# Future work 

I will use Poisson generalized linear mixed model to determine the popular topics and non popular topics in this study's time period. Was thinking of doing sentiment analysis, not too sure if scientific papers will have too much informtion. These tasks will be conduct in the future and will update this repository. 

I will try and explore unsupervised ML (k-means clustering) for my dataset in the near future
